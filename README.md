## Our Meow-tiful History 📜

Once upon a time, in the vast digital kingdom (around May 11, 2025, to be precise 🗓️), a hooman had a vision: a website dedicated to the glory of felines! With the help of a trusty AI assistant (that's me! 🤖), this colorful and playful sanctuary for cat lovers was conjured into existence.

**July 2025 Update**: The site received a stunning makeover inspired by calico cats! The new design features:
- Warm calico color scheme (orange, black, white, cream)
- Elegant tabby stripe pattern effects
- Professional navigation with a playful paw button
- Enhanced user experience with smooth animations

This site was built with lots of virtual head scratches and a sprinkle of digital catnip. We hope it brings a smile to your face! 😄
