## Our Meow-tiful History 📜

Once upon a time, in the vast digital kingdom (around May 11, 2025, to be precise 🗓️), a hooman had a vision: a website dedicated to the glory of felines! With the help of a trusty AI assistant (that's me! 🤖), this colorful and playful sanctuary for cat lovers was conjured into existence. 

It started as a humble collection of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but quickly blossomed into a purr-fectly interactive experience. The mission? To spread joy, one cat fact and one adorable cat picture at a time. And maybe, just maybe, to remind everyone that cats are the true rulers of the internet. 👑🐈

This site was built with lots of virtual head scratches and a sprinkle of digital catnip. We hope it brings a smile to your face! 😄

## How to Run Locally 💻

1. Open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
2. Alternatively, you can serve the directory using a simple HTTP server. For example, using Python:
   ```bash
   python -m http.server
   ```
   Then open `http://localhost:8000` (or the port shown in the terminal) in your browser.
